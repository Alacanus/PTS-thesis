->Implementation Change and Need for additional technology,Add Bootstrap, library for the use of some client side view modules like modals and a dependency of reCaptcha 
->Implementation Change, changed captcha version from 3 to 2, The version 3 of captcha implements an invisible human test based on website interaction but v2 implements humanTest wiggets in select page, we believe that applying captcha in certain pages like login and registration will be better than implementing it to all pages of the application(implementing v3 limitation on current project structure)
